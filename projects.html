                    <p>In this project, a Virtual Reality (VR) system has been designed and developed for use in the rehabilitation of adults with neurogenic communication disorders. VR has the potential to provide a safe, supported life-like environment in which people undergoing communication rehabilitation could practice therapy tasks and gain confidence before entering actual real-world communication contexts.
                    The aim of this project is to investigate the perspectives of speech pathologists about the use of VR and the simulated kitchen tool for people with communication disorders as a means to optimise rehabilitation engagement and outcomes.</p>

                    <p>Over 75% of individuals with acquired brain injury experience a communication disorder worldwide. Such disorders could impair their ability to produce clear speech and understand what is said to them and also express their ideas clearly. Communication disorders may have continuing impacts on employment, social participation and quality of life. Technology-enabled interventions such as mobile apps have the potential to extend the reach of speech-language therapy to treat communication disorders, especially in rural and remote areas. However, ensuring apps are evidence-based and high-quality is critical for facilitating safe and effective treatment for adults with communication disorders.</p>

                        <p>During the SheCodes2020, I have developed a personal portfolio in HTML and CSS, learned the fundamentals of programming with Python, created a news website in Django and a crowdfunding website in React. I also used git to track my code, and agile methodologies to create projects in small teams. I participated in masterclasses for accessibility, design, devops, security and hardware.</p>
